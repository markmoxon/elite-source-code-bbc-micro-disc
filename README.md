## Introduction

This repository contains source code for the disc version of Elite on the BBC Micro, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained.

You can build the fully functioning game from this source. [Three variants](#building-different-variants-of-the-disc-version-of-elite) are currently supported: the disc version from Ian Bell's personal website, the disc version from the Stairway to Hell archive, and the unreleased sideways RAM variant from Ian Bell's personal website.

It is a companion to the [elite.bbcelite.com website](https://elite.bbcelite.com), which contains all the code from this repository, but laid out in a much more human-friendly fashion. The links at the top of this page will take you to repositories for the other versions of Elite that are covered by this project.

* If you want to browse the source and read about how Elite works under the hood, you will probably find [the website](https://elite.bbcelite.com) is a better place to start than this repository.

* If you would rather explore the source code in your favourite IDE, then the [annotated source](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-source.asm) is what you're looking for. It contains the exact same content as the website, so you won't be missing out (the website is generated from the source files, so they are guaranteed to be identical). You might also like to read the section on [Browsing the source in an IDE](#browsing-the-source-in-an-ide) for some tips.

* If you want to build Elite from the source on a modern computer, to produce a working game disc that can be loaded into a BBC Micro or an emulator, then you want the section on [Building Elite from the source](#building-elite-from-the-source).

My hope is that this repository and the [accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com) will be useful for those who want to learn more about Elite and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate one of the most iconic games of the 8-bit era.

## Acknowledgements

Elite was written by Ian Bell and David Braben and is copyright &copy; Acornsoft 1984.

The code on this site has been reconstructed from a disassembly of the version released on [Ian Bell's personal website](http://www.elitehomepage.org/).

The commentary is copyright &copy; Mark Moxon. Any misunderstandings or mistakes in the documentation are entirely my fault.

Huge thanks are due to the original authors for not only creating such an important piece of my childhood, but also for releasing the source code for us to play with; to Paul Brink for his annotated disassembly; and to Kieran Connell for his [BeebAsm version](https://github.com/kieranhj/elite-beebasm), which I forked as the original basis for this project. You can find more information about this project in the [accompanying website's project page](https://elite.bbcelite.com/about_site/about_this_project.html).

Thanks to the Bitshifters for their help in building the [musical version of BBC Micro Elite](#bbc-micro-elite-with-music), and in particular Kieran Connell, Simon Morris and Negative Charge for the music player and ported music files. Thanks also to Tricky and J.G.Harston for their sideways RAM utilities.

### A note on licences, copyright etc.

This repository is _not_ provided with a licence, and there is intentionally no `LICENSE` file provided.

According to [GitHub's licensing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository), this means that "the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work".

The reason for this is that my commentary is intertwined with the original Elite source code, and the original source code is copyright. The whole site is therefore covered by default copyright law, to ensure that this copyright is respected.

Under GitHub's rules, you have the right to read and fork this repository... but that's it. No other use is permitted, I'm afraid.

My hope is that the educational and non-profit intentions of this repository will enable it to stay hosted and available, but the original copyright holders do have the right to ask for it to be taken down, in which case I will comply without hesitation. I do hope, though, that along with the various other disassemblies and commentaries of this source, it will remain viable.

## Browsing the source in an IDE

If you want to browse the source in an IDE, you might find the following useful.

* The most interesting files are in the [main-sources](1-source-files/main-sources) folder:

  * The main game's source code is in the [elite-source-flight.asm](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-source-flight.asm) and [elite-source-docked.asm](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-source-docked.asm) files (for when we're in-flight or docked) - this is the motherlode and probably contains all the stuff you're interested in.

  * The game's loader is in the [elite-loader1.asm](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-loader1.asm), [elite-loader2.asm](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-loader2.asm) and [elite-loader3.asm](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-loader3.asm) files - these are mainly concerned with setup and copy protection.

* It's probably worth skimming through the [notes on terminology and notations](https://elite.bbcelite.com/terminology/) on the accompanying website, as this explains a number of terms used in the commentary, without which it might be a bit tricky to follow at times (in particular, you should understand the terminology I use for multi-byte numbers).

* The accompanying website contains [a number of "deep dive" articles](https://elite.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/), each of which goes into an aspect of the game in detail. Routines that are explained further in these articles are tagged with the label `Deep dive:` and the relevant article name.

* There are loads of routines and variables in Elite - literally hundreds. You can find them in the source files by searching for the following: `Type: Subroutine`, `Type: Variable`, `Type: Workspace` and `Type: Macro`.

* If you know the name of a routine, you can find it by searching for `Name: <name>`, as in `Name: SCAN` (for the 3D scanner routine) or `Name: LL9` (for the ship-drawing routine).

* The entry point for the [main game code](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-source-docked.asm) is routine `TT170`, which you can find by searching for `Name: TT170`. If you want to follow the program flow all the way from the title screen around the main game loop, then you can find a number of [deep dives on program flow](https://elite.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/) on the accompanying website.

* The source code is designed to be read at an 80-column width and with a monospaced font, just like in the good old days.

I hope you enjoy exploring the inner workings of BBC Elite as much as I have.

## Folder structure

There are five main folders in this repository, which reflect the order of the build process.

* [1-source-files](1-source-files) contains all the different source files, such as the main assembler source files, image binaries, fonts, boot files and so on.

* [2-build-files](2-build-files) contains build-related scripts, such as the checksum, encryption and crc32 verification scripts.

* [3-assembled-output](3-assembled-output) contains the output from the assembly process, when the source files are assembled and the results processed by the build files.

* [4-reference-binaries](4-reference-binaries) contains the correct binaries for each variant, so we can verify that our assembled output matches the reference.

* [5-compiled-game-discs](5-compiled-game-discs) contains the final output of the build process: an SSD disc image that contains the compiled game and which can be run on real hardware or in an emulator.

## Flicker-free Elite

This repository also includes a flicker-free version, which incorporates the backported flicker-free ship-drawing routines from the BBC Master, as well as a fix for planets so they no longer flicker. The flicker-free code is in a separate branch called `flicker-free`, and apart from the code differences for reducing flicker, this branch is identical to the main branch and the same build process applies.

The annotated source files in the `flicker-free` branch contain both the original Acornsoft code and all of the modifications for flicker-free Elite, so you can look through the source to see exactly what's changed. Any code that I've removed from the original version is commented out in the source files, so when they are assembled they produce the flicker-free binaries, while still containing details of all the modifications. You can find all the diffs by searching the sources for `Mod:`.

The repository also includes a variant that incorporates both the flicker-free ship-drawing routines and a fix for planets so they no longer flicker, though this version only works when running on a BBC Master. The flicker-free code is in a separate branch called `bbc-master-flicker-free`.

For more information on flicker-free Elite, see the [hacks section of the accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/flicker-free_elite.html).

## BBC Micro Elite with music

This repository also includes a version of BBC Micro Elite that includes the music from the Commodore 64 version. The music-specific code is in a separate branch called `music`, and apart from the code differences for adding the music, this branch is identical to the main branch and the same build process applies.

The annotated source files in the `music` branch contain both the original Acornsoft code and all of the modifications for the musical version of Elite, so you can look through the source to see exactly what's changed. Any code that I've removed from the original version is commented out in the source files, so when they are assembled they produce the music-enabled binaries, while still containing details of all the modifications. You can find all the diffs by searching the sources for `Mod:`.

The music itself is built as a sideways ROM using the code in the [elite-music repository](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-music/).

For more information on the music, see the [hacks section of the accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/bbc_elite_with_music.html).

## BBC Micro Elite on the BBC Master

This repository also includes a version of BBC Micro disc Elite that will run on a BBC Master (unlike the original, which crashes when loaded into a Master). The BBC Master version is in a separate branch called `bbc-master`, and apart from the code differences for supporting the Master, this branch is identical to the main branch and the same build process applies.

The annotated source files in the `bbc-master` branch contain both the original Acornsoft code and all of the modifications required to make BBC Micro Elite run on the Master, so you can look through the source to see exactly what's changed. Any code that I've removed from the original version is commented out in the source files, so when they are assembled they produce the Master-compatible binaries, while still containing details of all the modifications. You can find all the diffs by searching the sources for `Mod:`.

The repository also includes a variant of the BBC Master version that incorporates both the flicker-free ship-drawing routines and a fix for planets so they no longer flicker. The flicker-free code is in a separate branch called `bbc-master-flicker-free`.

For more information on the port to the BBC Master, see the [hacks section of the accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/bbc_master_disc_elite.html).

## Elite Compendium

This repository also includes a version of BBC Micro disc Elite for the Elite Compendium, which incorporates all the available hacks in one game. The Compendium versions are in separate branches called `elite-compendium-bbc-master` and `elite-compendium-bbc-micro`, which are included in the [Elite Compendium (BBC Master)](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-compendium-bbc-master) and [Elite Compendium (BBC Micro)](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-compendium-bbc-micro) repositories as submodules.

The annotated source files in the `elite-compendium` branch contain both the original Acornsoft code and all of the modifications for the Elite Compendium, so you can look through the source to see exactly what's changed. Any code that I've removed from the original version is commented out in the source files, so when they are assembled they produce the Compendium binaries, while still containing details of all the modifications. You can find all the diffs by searching the sources for `Mod:`.

For more information on the Elite Compendium, see the [hacks section of the accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/elite_compendium.html).

## Elite over Econet

This repository also includes a version of BBC Micro disc Elite that loads over Econet and supports multiplayer scoreboards. The Elite over Econet version is in a separate branch called `econet`, which is included in the [Elite over Econet](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-over-econet) repository as a submodule.

The annotated source files in the `econet` branch contain both the original Acornsoft code and all of the modifications for Elite over Econet, so you can look through the source to see exactly what's changed. Any code that I've removed from the original version is commented out in the source files, so when they are assembled they produce the Elite over Econet binaries, while still containing details of all the modifications. You can find all the diffs by searching the sources for `Mod:`.

For more information on Elite over Econet, see the [hacks section of the accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/elite_over_econet.html).

## Building Elite from the source

Builds are supported for both Windows and Mac/Linux systems. In all cases the build process is defined in the `Makefile` provided.

### Requirements

You will need the following to build Elite from the source:

* BeebAsm, which can be downloaded from the [BeebAsm repository](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm). Mac and Linux users will have to build their own executable with `make code`, while Windows users can just download the `beebasm.exe` file.

* Python. The build process has only been tested on 3.x, but 2.7 should work.

* Mac and Linux users may need to install `make` if it isn't already present (for Windows users, `make.exe` is included in this repository).

For details of how the build process works, see the [build documentation on bbcelite.com](https://elite.bbcelite.com/about_site/building_elite.html).

Let's look at how to build Elite from the source.

### Windows

For Windows users, there is a batch file called `make.bat` which you can use to build the game. Before this will work, you should edit the batch file and change the values of the `BEEBASM` and `PYTHON` variables to point to the locations of your `beebasm.exe` and `python.exe` executables. You also need to change directory to the repository folder (i.e. the same folder as `make.bat`).

All being well, entering the following into a command window:

```
make.bat
```

will produce a file called `elite-disc-sth.ssd` in the `5-compiled-game-discs` folder that contains the Stairway to Hell variant, which you can then load into an emulator, or into a real BBC Micro using a device like a Gotek.

### Mac and Linux

The build process uses a standard GNU `Makefile`, so you just need to install `make` if your system doesn't already have it. If BeebAsm or Python are not on your path, then you can either fix this, or you can edit the `Makefile` and change the `BEEBASM` and `PYTHON` variables in the first two lines to point to their locations. You also need to change directory to the repository folder (i.e. the same folder as `Makefile`).

All being well, entering the following into a terminal window:

```
make
```

will produce a file called `elite-disc-sth.ssd` in the `5-compiled-game-discs` folder that contains the Stairway to Hell variant, which you can then load into an emulator, or into a real BBC Micro using a device like a Gotek.

### Build options

By default the build process will create a typical Elite game disc with a standard commander and verified binaries. There are various arguments you can pass to the build to change how it works. They are:

* `variant=<name>` - Build the specified variant:

  * `variant=sth` (default)
  * `variant=ib-disc`
  * `variant=sideways-ram`

* `commander=max` - Start with a maxed-out commander (specifically, this is the test commander file from the original source, which is almost but not quite maxed-out)

* `encrypt=no` - Disable encryption and checksum routines

* `match=no` - Do not attempt to match the original game binaries (i.e. omit workspace noise)

* `verify=no` - Disable crc32 verification of the game binaries

So, for example:

`make variant=ib-disc commander=max encrypt=no match=no verify=no`

will build an unencrypted version of the variant from Ian Bell's website, with a maxed-out commander, no workspace noise and no crc32 verification.

The unencrypted version should be more useful for anyone who wants to make modifications to the game code. As this argument produces unencrypted files, the binaries produced will be quite different to the binaries on the original source disc, which are encrypted.

See below for more on the verification process.

### Updating the checksum scripts if you change the code

If you change the source code in any way, you may break the game; if so, it will typically hang at the loading screen, though in some versions it may hang when launching from the space station.

To fix this, you may need to update some of the hard-coded addresses in the checksum script so that they match the new addresses in your changed version of the code. See the comments in the [elite-checksum.py](2-build-files/elite-checksum.py) script for details.

### Verifying the output

The default build process prints out checksums of all the generated files, along with the checksums of the files from the original sources. You can disable verification by passing `verify=no` to the build.

The Python script `crc32.py` in the `2-build-files` folder does the actual verification, and shows the checksums and file sizes of both sets of files, alongside each other, and with a Match column that flags any discrepancies. If you are building an unencrypted set of files then there will be lots of differences, while the encrypted files should mostly match (see the Differences section below for more on this).

The binaries in the `4-reference-binaries` folder are those extracted from the released version of the game, while those in the `3-assembled-output` folder are produced by the build process. For example, if you don't make any changes to the code and build the project with `make`, then this is the output of the verification process:

```

```

All the compiled binaries match the originals, so we know we are producing the same final game as the Stairway to Hell variant.

### Log files

During compilation, details of every step are output in a file called `compile.txt` in the `3-assembled-output` folder. If you have problems, it might come in handy, and it's a great reference if you need to know the addresses of labels and variables for debugging (or just snooping around).

### Auto-deploying to the b2 emulator

For users of the excellent [b2 emulator](https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2), you can include the build parameter `b2` to automatically load and boot the assembled disc image in b2. The b2 emulator must be running for this to work.

For example, to build, verify and load the game into b2, you can do this on Windows:

```
make.bat all b2
```

or this on Mac/Linux:

```
make all b2
```

If you omit the `all` target then b2 will start up with the results of the last successful build.

Note that you should manually choose the correct platform in b2 (I intentionally haven't automated this part to make it easier to test across multiple platforms).

## Building different variants of the disc version of Elite

This repository contains the source code for two different variants of the disc version of Elite:

* The variant from the Stairway to Hell archive

* The variant from the game disc on Ian Bell's website

* The sideways RAM variant from Ian Bell's website

By default the build process builds the Stairway to Hell variant, but you can build a specified variant using the `variant=` build parameter.

### Building the Stairway to Hell variant

You can add `variant=sth` to produce the `elite-disc-sth.ssd` file containing the Stairway to Hell variant, though that's the default value so it isn't necessary. In other words, you can build it like this:

```
make.bat variant=sth
```

or this on a Mac or Linux:

```
make variant=sth
```

This will produce a file called `elite-disc-sth.ssd` in the `5-compiled-game-discs` folder that contains the Stairway to Hell variant.

The verification checksums for this version are as follows:

```

### Building the Ian Bell disc variant

You can build the Ian Bell disc variant by appending `variant=ib-disc` to the `make` command, like this on Windows:

```
make.bat variant=ib-disc
```

or this on a Mac or Linux:

```
make variant=ib-disc
```

This will produce a file called `elite-disc-ib-disc.ssd` in the `5-compiled-game-discs` folder that contains the Ian Bell disc variant.

The verification checksums for this version are as follows:

```

The failed matches are because I haven't yet converted the loader into BeebAsm source files (see the next section for details).

### Building the sideways RAM variant

You can build the sideways RAM variant by appending `variant=sideways-ram` to the `make` command, like this on Windows:

```
make.bat variant=sideways-ram
```

or this on a Mac or Linux:

```
make variant=sideways-ram
```

This will produce a file called `elite-disc-sideways-ram.ssd` in the `5-compiled-game-discs` folder that contains the sideways RAM variant.

The verification checksums for this version are as follows:

```

### Differences between the variants

You can see the differences between the variants by searching the source code for `_STH_DISC` (for features in the Stairway to Hell variant), `_IB_DISC` (for features in the Ian Bell game disc variant) or `_SRAM_DISC` (for features in the sideways RAM variant). There are only a few differences between the Ian Bell variant and the others:

* The Ian Bell variant contains the refund bug, which has been fixed in the other variants

* The Ian Bell variant never spawns asteroids, which has been fixed in the other variants

* The Ian Bell variant sets bit 2 of the competition flag in the commander file, while the other variants set bit 5

In other words, the Ian Bell variant appears to be the very first release of the disc version of Elite, while the Stairway to Hell and sideways RAM variants have both bugs fixed and a bumped-up number in the competition flag.

The sideways RAM variant has the following extra features:

* All ship blueprints are available in sideways RAM at the same time, so all ship types can appear at any time without the restrictions of the disc version's blueprint files, and loading is quicker on launch and there is no disc access at all when hyperspacing

* The missile blueprint is the version from the non-disc versions

* The scanner shows the space station, asteroids, escape pods and cargo in red, as opposed to the yellow/green of the original

* Different parts of the copy protection are disabled compared to the other variants

* The main docked and flight binaries in T.CODE and D.CODE are not encrypted

* The sideways RAM loader is a mod in the true sense, in that it works with the normal disc version, converting it to work with sideways RAM

See the [accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com/disc/releases.html) for a comprehensive list of differences between the variants.

Note that I have only included differences that appear in the main game code, rather than those that appear in the loaders, as these files can differ extensively between variants without affecting the game itself. The variant on Ian Bell's personal website contains a whole load of copy protection differences when compared to the same code in the Stairway to Hell variant, and it also contains two more binary files (`ELITE5` and `ELITE6`), plus a `!BOOT` file that contains even more copy protection code. I haven't disassembled the loader files from this variant as that's a whole different rabbit hole, so if you build the Ian Bell variant with `make`, the compiled loader binaries will not match those extracted from the original disc. The main binaries will match, however, which is the interesting part from a digital archaeology perspective, as that's where the bug fixes live.

Right on, Commanders!
